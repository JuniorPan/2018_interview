 * Testcase Example:  '"abccccdd"'
 *
 * Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return
 * the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.
 * 
 * Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome
 * here.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "abccccdd"
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation:
 * One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "a"
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "bb"
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 2000
 * s consits of lower-case and/or upper-case English letters only.
